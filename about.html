        <p>
          Our hospital was established in 1995 with the vision of providing affordable, 
          high-quality healthcare services. Over the years, we have grown into a 
          multi-specialty healthcare center, serving thousands of patients annually. 
          What began as a small community clinic has expanded into a trusted institution 
          with advanced diagnostic and treatment facilities. Today, our hospital stands 
          as a symbol of dedication and commitment to community health.
